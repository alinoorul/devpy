The people that make the best company reap the greatest rewards, but if a team makes a better (more efficient, leaner) company for an industry, the government encourages replacement of the incumbent company with the new one in the market enpoly. This ensures the best company rules the market, and the criteria for best is determined by people and algorithms. One of the biggest problems of monopolies is stagnancy; monopolies become stagnant due to their massive sizes. They fail to innovate and reap highest rewards due to market dominance. The Matrix Government regulates this through an annual company review that tests incumbents and competitors on a scale to determine which company should dominate a particular industry or market. This maintains a free market in an enpoly system. Since The Matrix Government is incentivized for the good of its electorate, it acts as a trusted control layer over corporations to maintain a free market not corrupted by lobbying. The Matrix Government profits from certain businesses and funds loss leaders like free healthcare, education, housing for all, national parks, and libraries. These services build trust in The Matrix Government.",

You can expect the same standard of healthcare in every state or country where The Matrix Government is elected.

Other companies with better models are encouraged to stand up for elections against The Matrix Government.",

            "Matrixims has collections of biological neurons controlling avatars in a video game. A collection of neuronal stem cells is allowed to form a clump of cells called an organoid. This organoid is densely connected with needle-like electrodes. Electrical signals picked up from these electrodes are based on neural activity in the organoid. These signals are parsed to generate actions for a non-player character(NPC)/avatar/sim in a simulated world. In the game (The Sims 1), these avatars can eat, sleep, form relationships, have children, go to work, interact positively or negatively with other avatars, form relationships etc; but they're mostly controlled by digital logic. They have a mood meter composed of 8 primary needs (including hunger, sleep, social) which are on a linear scale. Certain actions like eating, sleeping, interacting with other avatars increase specific numbers on the mood meter, while a lack of those activities decreases them. The mood meter is converted into electrical signals and relayed back to the organoid through electrodes as feedback. This feedback may be fed back to the organoid using other electrodes connected to different areas of the organoid, as compared to electrodes connected to take input signals from the organoid. These organoids have <a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2022.09.001'>demonstrated an ability to manage internal signals to learn how to play Pong</a>. The resolution of their activity needs to be significantly increased to achieve optimization of the mood meter, which is the goal of Matrixims (demonstrate ability of neurons in a dish to optimize their behavior in a digital world). How they optimize it should have insights into intelligence and brains. Matrixims is a model system of the brain in an cohabitated environment. An organoid controls one avatar in the shared game (possibly The Sims 1) and collections of organoids control multiple avatars that exist in a shared neighborhood of The Sims.

The concept of \u201cless\u201d information exists only because of information difference. This concept is explored well in Shannon entropy. Information has meaning only because of a difference in observations, hence the need to encode something different. This means we have to bring about another bit of information, or change a bit of information. If nothing exists, then it is the absence of all possible things. It is the absence of all possible 2^N states of any system. There is a more fundamental operation than NOT. It is \u201cnothing\u201d.",

But then how is it empty? The statement \u201cthe empty set contains itself\u201d is a true statement that cannot be explained by system by which it was created: ZFC. I call it a Godel statement. Am I right? Can it not be explained by the axioms of set theory?",
            "English is based on phonetics. Words are created so that we (mostly people in the English-speaking world) can speak. While English as a language (~30 letters) as high informational density, it is limited by human phonetics. English words primarily exist so we can speak them. Hence the limitation of English in primary keys. Using breaks in the English language and randomized spread of letters (context, i.e language dependent), we can construct many many concepts. And it has helped us. But English is limited for the language of science. To label observations, the sheer quantity of them, we need more than English. We can no longer label \u201clight\u201d and \u201cdark\u201d to observations. We need numbers. But the human mind is attuned to words. We relate concepts we know to words. So much to words that we rarely experience things we cannot characterize in words. Which is weird. People experience qualia all the time but rarely, people talk about it. Yet people talk about it all the time without using the word \u201cqualia\u201d. It is the feeling of \u201c feelin \u2019 myself\u201d. Qualia, in essence, in modern terminology. To encode the same feeling, we use two different terms. But the deeper truth is that we interpret things using neurons. Our optic nerve lights up, lighting up neurons in our heads, which light others. Somewhere along the way self perception kicks in, but usually without self-perception about self-perception (thinking about qualia). Self -perception is the experience of seeing red and realizing you\u2019re seeing red. Unlike background noise, you realize you\u2019re having a specific experience. Having that experience, instead of having an experience which is thinking about having that experience. Like the one I am having right now. This moment I am thinking about how I am writing about this. This experience I am having, the sensation of realizing qualia, is a \u201csticky experience\u201d. I can come to this specific experience from many experiences. It is a local minima, a sort of rest state. Self-awareness and awareness about qualia are also neuronal xperiences (neurons lighting up in the head), which can come from a lot of different states.",
            "My point is this: before we had the ability to measure waves in the brain, we would describe our brain states with words, simply by having limited number of states we know of to describe. Now that we know a lot more states, we need more bits to store information about these states (representations). A core point I am trying to make is that when we start having experiences by controlling each neuron directly, we will need a lot more than words to encode what those experiences are. But to understand larger number of experiences, we would need bigger brains that store more meta-information about neuronal states (memory). ",
            "The treatise on the specificity of language is small: information content of a language is dependent on the number of different states it needs to define to and who it needs to define it to. If there is no information content in a system, it doesn\u2019t need to describe anything. Hence the all-capturing sticky void of nothing is where it resides. Equal to every else. Science is so much about debate. Yes or No to a question. But what happens when Yes and No aren\u2019t enough? When you can\u2019t divide scientists into 2 camps and come up with an answer, because there are many answers and scientists cannot even read all answers. What happens then?"

This is based on the idea of having n different superpositions interacting in a system but measuring (recording) only a few of them. The few that show periodicity in randomly distributed solution space. It is possibly easier to find periodity if it is inherent in the solution space.

The room is furnished, all utilities are paid for, is cleaned every week. Basically, we take the headache out of life. Monthly payments, rent, insurance, utility bills, other bills: we take care of it all. Just book a place and stay in it like a hotel room that is your own. Choose your furiture or get a standard set. Pay us a bit extra and we'll make sure your payments end. Basically, you will own where you live. If you choose, that can be a home. Or you can keep on rentalifing (the future of renting). When I came to the US, it was shocking to me that all houses, even the unfurnished ones, had a stove, dishwasher, oven, and laundry machines. This is a standard of life not found in India. Sure, you can choose a furnished apartment and that will cost more. But these appliances don't come as standard in EVERY home. Rentalife aims to increase the standard of living. When you rent a home, it will always be furnished. All utilities will always be paid for. The property will be cleaned and maintained and insured. You just have to pay rent. That's all you need to do, we will take care of the rest. Upping the standard. Rent a life is designed for people to change their lives every month. If they want, they can be in Rome in one month, Morocco the next, Cuba the third. No first month, last month rents, security, or brokerage EVER. Just rent. Give rent, get a place for a month with a car and groceries. The place has a new standard that it is a longterm hotel. This is what we're selling. Freedom. Not house, car, groceries. Freedom. This is an extensible concept. Rentalife can have rentals everywhere. Moon, mars, deep space, other galaxies: anywhere. Just book and place, get there and it's yours. Our plan is to be a global landowner. We mulled over the franchise concept but we feel we'll lose control. Let's build a brand first by doing it completely in-house. Then we'll franchise out MAYBE.

It is close to my heart because homeownership is a distant dream for some close to me. I saw people renting homes with rents higher than mortgages. I thought why not use rents over a 30 -year period to give tenants a house? Why suck money for 100s of years? Take rent for 30 years from someone and give them the house they live in. I did some math inspired from an algorithm I designed which was inspired from Bitcoin. I was fairly confident of the math. Lazrlake would buy homes in many places and increase ownership in an idea of a home that wasn't rooted in space. Basically, over 30 years a person moves from Tokyo to Delhi to Nairobi to LA. They pay rent to live in houses owned by Lazrlake in those places. After 30 years, the home they're living in is given to them as their property. Like a 30-year mortgage for a home."

Imagine the world simulated in <a href='matrixims.html'>Matrixims</a> can send stimuli to bots to generate conversations (and later on behavior), between bots and between the bot and itself. Stimuli are based on 2^N states. Using a pseudorandom number generator to label states and picking states randomly without traversing the entire state space allows us to traverse a state space uniquely. Certain subsections of this randomly selected n-bit string are used as stimuli to bots, because bot stimuli input is of lower resolution compared to N. Because of the state space being so large, and impossible to traverse in finite time, essentially indeterministic, we simulate pseudo-infinity. Each bot's behavior is influenced by a random state in this pseudo-infinite space, and bots can interact with each other, which can result in unique scenarios occurring in Matrixims that are effectively unpredictable, and thus completely new.",
